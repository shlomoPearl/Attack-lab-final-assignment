Demonstration of stealing information from an application APK file using smali.
The stolen information is stored in informaton.txt
magicDate.apk is the real app.
command.sh is the script I used to perform the re-sign process after modifying the app's code with smali.
You can drag the apps into the emulator in Android Studio and it will install them by itself.
